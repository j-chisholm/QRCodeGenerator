# QRCodeGenerator
Python code that generates QR codes from a CSV file.

This python code generates QR codes from a single csv file given the filename, column to generate from, and the name of the heading to skip. I created it primarily for my workplace to assist us in conducting inventory. I've added and removed code in order to make it more generic for others to use.
